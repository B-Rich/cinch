= Cinch: The IRC Microframework

== Description

Cinch is an IRC Microframework for quickly creating IRC bots
in Ruby with minimal effort.
It provides a minimal interface based on plugins and rules. It's as simple as creating a
plugin, defining a rule, and watching your profits flourish.

Cinch will do all of the hard work for you, so you can spend time creating cool plugins
and extensions to wow your internet peers.

== Installation

=== RubyGems
You can install the latest version of Cinch using RubyGems
 gem install cinch

=== GitHub
Alternatively you can check out the latest code directly from Github
 git clone http://github.com/injekt/cinch.git

== Example

Your typical <em>Hello, World</em> application would go something like this:

 require 'cinch'

 bot = Cinch.setup do
   server "irc.freenode.org"
   nick "Cinch"
 end

 bot.plugin "hello" do |m|
   m.reply "Hello, #{m.nick}!"
 end

 bot.run

It doesn't take much to work out what's happening here, but I'll explain it anyway.

First we run the <em>Cinch::setup</em> block which is required in every application. Cinch is boxed
with a load of default values, so the <b>only</b> option required in this block is the <em>server</em>
option. We then define a plugin using the <em>plugin</em> method and pass it a rule (a String in this
case). Every plugin must be mapped to a rule. When the rule matches an IRC message its block is
invoked, the contents of which contains your plugin interface. The variable passed to the block is
an instance of IRC::Message. This provides us with a couple of helper methods which can be used to
reply to a message. See Cinch::IRC::Message#reply and Cinch::IRC::Message#answer

This example would provide the following response on IRC:

 * Cinch has joined #cinch
 injekt> !hello
 Cinch> Hello, injekt!

Plugins are invoked using the command prefix character (which by default is set to <b>!</b>). You can
also tell Cinch to ignore any command prefix and instead use the bots username. This would provide
a result similar to this:

 injekt> Cinch: hello
 Cinch> Hello, injekt!

Cinch also provides named parameters. This method of expression was inspired by the {Sinatra
Web Framework}[http://www.sinatrarb.com/] and although it doesn't quite follow the same pattern,
it's useful for naming parameters passed to plugins. These paramaters are available through the 
Cinch::IRC::Message#args method which is passed to each plugin.

 bot.plugin("say :text") do |m|
   m.reply m.args[:text]
 end

This plugin would provide the following output:

 injekt> !say foo bar baz
 Cinch> foo bar baz

Each plugin takes an optional hash of message specific options. These options provide an extension to
the rules given, for example if we want to reply only if the nick sending the message is injekt, we
could pass the 'nick' option to the hash.

 bot.plugin("join :channel", :nick => 'injekt') do |m|
   m.join #{m.args[:channel]}
 end
