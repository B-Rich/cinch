Cinch - An IRC Bot Building Framework
=====================================

Description
-----------

Cinch is an IRC Bot Building Framework for quickly creating IRC bots in
Ruby with minimal effort. It provides a simple interface based on plugins and
rules. It's as easy as creating a plugin, defining a rule, and watching your
profits flourish.

Cinch will do all of the hard work for you, so you can spend time creating cool
plugins and extensions to wow your internet peers.

If you'd like to test your own Cinch experiments you can do so in the
\#cinch-bots IRC channel on
[irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/cinch-bots). For general
support, join [#cinch](irc://irc.freenode.org/cinch).
